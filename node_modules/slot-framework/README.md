==============

Closing the gap between server and client side, Slot is a Cross Side Web Framework that let you reuse the same code on client and server side.

## How to use?
This module contains all components to develop web projects using [Slot Framework](http://www.SlotFramework.org), 
but to ease your work, we has created the [Slot Command Line](https://www.npmjs.org/package/slot-cli).

Just execute the next to install the command-line global on your machine:

    $ npm install -g slot-cli

Execute the next to build you HelloWorld project:

    $ slot create hello

Execute the next command to add a 'demoPage.html' page:

    $ cd hello
    $ slot add -p demoPage

And finaly execute the next to start up the Designer Server, and start prototiping you app: 

    $ slot start
      
      
         DESIGNER Server on http://localhost:800/
